## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
x = rnorm(n=100, mean=5, sd=1)
sd(x)
```
```{r}
help(hist)
hist(x, las=1, main="Histogram", col="blue")
```


```{r}
set.seed(1)
x=rnorm(50,10,2)
```


```{r}
se_x=sqrt(var(x)/length(x))
out=NULL
for(i in 1:1000){
  sample=sample(x, replace=TRUE)
  out[i]=mean(sample)
}
```


```{r}
hist(out, las=1, main="histogram")
```
```{r}
sd(out)
```


```{r}
se_x
```
```{r}
quantile(out, c(0.025, 0.975))
```
```{r}
CV=NULL
for(i in 1:1000){
 sample=sample(x, replace=TRUE) 
 CV[i]=sd(sample)/mean(sample)
}
quantile(CV, c(0.025, 0.975))
```
